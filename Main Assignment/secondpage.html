      <h2>KRUSTY BURGERS</h2>
      <p>My name is Ben. I was born and raised in Wellington New Zealand basically my whole life. In 2012 my family and I moved to Melbourne for a year, I learnt some amazing skills and explored one of the most amazing cities ever. 
      <p>I made many new friends who I didn't want to leave after that year I had with them. I am now studying for a Bachelor of Creative Media Production, focusing towards both animation and film editing.  </p>
